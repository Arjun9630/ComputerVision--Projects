# Computer Vision Projects

Hey there! This repo is a collection of my hands-on computer vision mini-projects using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and various other libraries and technologies!  
I'm excited to share my progress and showcase the wonders of programming.  
You'll find my code examples and projects right here!

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Color Detection & Bounding Box](https://github.com/Arjun9630/ComputerVision--Projects/tree/main/Colour_Detection)
**Description:**  
My first OpenCV project where I built a real-time color detection system. It detects a specific color (like yellow or blue) in a live webcam feed and draws a bounding box around the detected area.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time webcam color detection using HSV color space
- Bounding box drawn around detected color
- Code includes clean, understandable comments

### Project 2: [Face Anonymizer using OpenCV & MediaPipe](https://github.com/Arjun9630/ComputerVision--Projects/tree/main/Face_Anonymizer)
**Description:**  
A real-time face anonymizer that detects human faces from a webcam feed using MediaPipe and applies a strong blur to hide facial identity. Great for privacy-aware apps and surveillance use cases.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time face detection using MediaPipe  
- Face region anonymized using Gaussian blur  
- Handles multiple faces in the frame
